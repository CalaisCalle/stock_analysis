# stock_analysis
Trying to analyse about 10000 stocks using Python.
The point of this is to try and create a diversified portfolio with a greater ROI than most fixed-rate ISAs in the UK.
This is *NOT* and algorithmic trading project.

## How

By taking advantage of the (AlphaVantage API)[https://www.alphavantage.co/], the program can pull time-series data from many different stock exchanges.
Unfortunately, the free-version of the API is rate-limited and so this project must limit its scope.
Hence the 10000 stock limit rather than using the full 60000+ stocks across the world.   

 Part of the selection process will be to pick only the securities with some level of history.
 This is largely to avoid "junk" stocks and reduce the risk of any portfolio created from this analysis.
 The aim is to create a diversified portfolio of 20-30 securities with an average APR of 5%.
 Time will tell if this is actually doable, given the current (2023) market conditions.

 ## Me

 I'm a software engineer by trade, but I've had an interest in the stock market for some time.
 However, I've never previously had the capital to invest seriously; instead being restricted to fractional shares.
